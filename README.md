# Game Dev Coursework

A game based on the given scenario: "Make a game based in Durham, where the player has to find items located around Durham (ie. a Treasure Hunt)".

In this interpretation, a 2D platformer game was made, with various levels based in different locations of Durham University. Each level can be attempted at any time, and completing a level grants a power up that may make other levels easier.

Things like pathfinding, random generation, grapple mechanics, jump/flight mechanics, and more are touched on.
